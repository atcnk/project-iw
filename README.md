# project-iw

I took a part as a game developer in this project but the project was canceled after a few months. 

In this repository, you can access all of my scripts (/Assets/Scripts) that I coded about the project.

I developed Player System & Input System for this game. Player System has movement and animation actions for the player. It was basic movement and animations but i tried to create generic systems.

In Input System, i wanted to try Unity's new input system. The player can be controlled by controller & mouse/keyboard.

There is also Environment System for interactions in general. I was doing something generic with Interfaces. That was the last thing i did before the game was cancelled.
